# turf.dart

A [turf.js](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf)-like geospatial analysis library working with GeoJSON, written in pure Dart.

This includes a fully [RFC 7946](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946)-compliant object-representation and serialization for GeoJSON.

Most of the implementation is a direct translation from [turf.js](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf).
